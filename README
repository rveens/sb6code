OpenGL SuperBible Example Code
------------------------------

This is the example code for the 6th Edition of OpenGL SuperBible.
The samples contained here mostly match up with the examples in the
book. There's a few extras here, and there's a few examples in the
book that don't have a runnable version here (either because they
are parts of the same application, or there just never was a finished
application).

There's some basic building instructions in HOWTOBUILD.txt. Everything
should work with Visual Studio on Windows and GNU make on Linux.
There are some hokey bits here. If you have serious issues, feel free
to fix and send pull requests.

There will always be a snapshot at http://www.openglsuperbible.com.
The live repository is at https://github.com/openglsuperbible/sb6code.
